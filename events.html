          <br />

          <b><center>DEX</center></b>

          <b>Scarlet</b>: When adventurers venture out into the ruins at night,
          they may hear an enchanting voice calling to them. By then, it is too
          late.
          <br />

          <b>Violet</b>: This Pokemon&apos;s cries are so harrowing that they
          send chills down the spines of even the bravest Pokemon Trainer.
          Caution is advised for this easily tempered Pokemon.
          <br />

          <b>Scarlet[Reborn]</b>: This Pokemon&apos;s latent power manifests
          into a will of battle fury and a lust for combat. The magical blades
          that it wields can cut through diamond.

          <br />
          <b>Violet[Reborn]</b>: Trainers lose their will to battle when meeting
          this Pokemon, as its sheer presence alone siphons their ability to
          stay sharp in the face of dangerous weaponry.
          <br />

          <b>Background</b>: Once upon a time gone, there was a royal family who
          prided themselves on their ability to bond with Pokemon. Strong
          warriors sparring with their powerful companions, fair maidens
          escorting their dear friends to and fro, and travelers feeling safe
          knowing that battle or ambush can be fought with their partner by
          their side. This family sat well and lavish within a forgotten
          kingdom, destined for a rich bloodline.

          <br />
          Until the Great War between Truth and Ideals broke out.

          <br />
          Whispers of who followed what reached the ears of the kingdom and the
          seeds of disarray sprouted like wildfire as citizens slowly grew
          distant from each other. Eventually, even those of the royal family
          fell victim to the age-old question: what value matters more in life -
          finding the truth and living by it, or following your ideals to the
          end and spreading them far and wide? Some went against this ultimatum,
          notably the daughter of the royal house&apos;s lord and lady, Eleanor.
          She saw that a world can live with both and to think one better than
          the other is foolhardy to seek conflict over.

          <br />
          Others did not agree.
          <br />

          Without mercy, she was cast out from her family and sent to the wolves
          like pigs to slaughter. They captured her, tortured her, and made her
          cry for nights on end as she pined for her family to forgive her and
          take her back in. There was no end to the creativity that
          rage-stricken peasants could use to make her life hell on earth, and
          every day was more and more reason to not go on. But she stayed
          strong, knowing that her truth to allow ideals to flourish while
          knowing the facts behind them will keep her alive through such a dark
          time.

          <br />
          But her will cannot stop the sharp end of a blade.

          <br />
          With one last cry out for her family that had forsaken her, Eleanor
          pleaded for the war to end and to bring peace to her kingdom and her
          family, having her final words cut short as she was stabbed clean
          through her broken heart and left to choke on her waning life before
          succumbing. The echoes of her cry did not go unnoticed, for the royal
          family - albeit still bitter for her not following their ideologies -
          were enraged at the news of her death.
          <br />

          Soon, the war fell into the lines of the innocent. Men, women,
          children, old and young, friends and lovers, all giving up their bonds
          for the sake to settle a score. The bloodshed was violent, and lasted
          for many an hour before finally, a cry was heard.
          <br />

          The cry of the slain princess, born again as a warrior of faith.

          <br />
          <b>Competitive niche?</b> (you are also allowed to provide sample
          sets)

          <br />
          Eledaia is a wall breaker, built to cover a wide selection of various
          walls thanks to its myriad of attacks favoring its notable Special
          Attack. Calm Mind sets allow it to build itself into either a strong
          late-game sweeper with STAB and coverage for Steel(Flamethrower/Fire
          Blast/Earth Power), Poison or strong Fighting types(Stored Power), or
          Bug types that resist Fairy. Nasty Plot sets lets it utilize its
          Special Attack much sooner at the cost of no extra bulk to ward off
          specially attacking walls that can sit and whittle it down. It also
          has a niche in being a pivot with Intimidate for an ability and
          Parting Shot to get back out before it gets hurt. Hydreigon, Iron
          Hands, Dragapult, and other OU threats have a hard time sitting in on
          Eledaia due to its decent STAB combo.

          <br />
          Leftover sets appreciate compiling passive healing with Recover, which
          allows it to live longer in a game of hazard chip that cannot be
          cleared.

          <br />
          Eledaia does suffer from being checked by common Scarfs like Gengar,
          offensive sets being walled by Toxapex or Unaware, defensive sets
          having to wait for things like Gholdengo or Crucibelle to be knocked
          out, or being forced back out from being able to set up by Venomicon
          or Cawmodore.
          <hr />

          Eledaia-Reborn is a wallbreaker built to cut through most walls.
          Swords Dance or even Life Orb sets make use of its vast array of
          physical moves, and Sharpness boosts all Slicing attacks to make
          normal checks risky. Although, Choice Band is a niche set that lets it
          forgo setup to use raw power instead, letting it fill in one more
          attack. Double Dance sets allow it to make use of Power Trip not being
          immune to anything compared to base Eledaia&apos;s Stored Power, and
          Weakness Policy sets have grown to a noticeable degree thanks to its
          decent 80/120/100 bulk to survive at least two non-Fighting attacks.
          <br />

          Defensive sets lose out on the ability to lower attack stats twice
          with Battle Armor instead of Intimidate, and supportive sets are
          lacking when its only moves to help a teammate in Double Battles are
          stat-lowering ones. Eledaia-Reborn&apos;s typing makes it a glass
          cannon to the numerous Fighting types in the meta, and defensive walls
          that can switch in on it carry Body Press, which limit the amount of
          opportunities it has to come in and clean up. Corviknight can live a
          Fire Last and hit back with Body Press, while things like Iron Hands
          or Cinderace shut it down before it can get going.
          <br />

          Eledaia-Blade appreciates teammates like Mollux who can help it stay
          out of fighting Toxapex, Plasmanta for Kerfluffle switchins, or
          Amoonguss to stop Breloom from clicking Mach Punch on it.

          Lysandre was a great scientist who was trying to make Mega Lapras, he
          tried different types of experiments and mega stones on lapras but got
          no result. Lysandre became obsessed with trying to make a water
          legendary threat for team flare, After all he merged the DNA of
          gyarados and lapras together and tried a mega stone on it. Eventually
          he got a shocking result, And a new pokemon called Masperent borns.
          Unfortunately it escaped Lysandre&apos;s Lab and went into
          Diablo&apos;s Ocean. It killed almost every water species, This is why
          it is called a modern predator. After so long it extinct because of
          climate change. But still we can restore it using Serpent Fossil.<br />

          <br />
          - Ally Fainted/Statused -	&gt; 10% increase in stats except

          At first look, pyramid scheme seems broken as a move, many pokemon in
          the meta can deal with it barring a few.

          <b>Lore:</b>

          Hundreds of years ago during the pokemon war, pokemon were brutally
          mistreated. Many pokemon were kept as livestock and were sold in the
          black market, one of them being calvstock. Most of these pokemon later
          became extinct. Calvstocks were on the verge of extinction but a few
          calvstock decided they had enough. They studied their environment and
          learnt the ways of the black market. They managed to escape from their
          owners and used their knowledge in the underground market to build a
          reputation. Calvstock are intelligent creatures and themselves being
          experienced with how underground dealings go, helped out a lot of
          shady businesses. Their experience in the black market later helped
          them evolve into Bulleon. Bulleon do not help bad people because they
          want to. It is because, the only way Bulleon would survive in their
          world is if they help criminal organisations. Bulleon were later kept
          and raised by big companies for help in investments and trade. The
          existence of bulleon was only revealed to the common folk when one of
          the biggest criminal organisations was apprehended and bulleons were
          found to be few of the masterminds behind their crimes.
